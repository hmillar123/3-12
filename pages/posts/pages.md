I like roasting coffee at home because for 8 entire minutes I can dedicate 100% of my focus to the task at hand. Roasting coffee is an experience that uses all of the senses including visual, smell, and listening to recognize how the roast itself is progressing. I enjoy trying out different varieties of coffee beans from around the world and pairing them with a great roast to make the best latte at home.
